# Crawling Issues and Solutions

## Current Challenges

### 1. JavaScript-Heavy Sites
Many modern websites load content dynamically via JavaScript after the initial page load. Our crawlers are getting navigation/shell content but missing the actual article/review content.

**Examples:**
- ForexPeaceArmy reviews
- Investopedia articles
- Many financial sites

### 2. Anti-Bot Protection
Sites implement various measures to block automated crawling:
- Cloudflare protection
- Rate limiting
- User-agent detection
- JavaScript challenges

### 3. Timeout Issues
Pages taking longer than 20-30 seconds to fully load cause timeouts.

## Solutions

### Short-term (Immediate)
1. **Use Admiral Markets' Own Data**
   - Process URLs from Admiral Markets' backlink reports
   - These are more likely to mention Admiral Markets
   - Focus on pages that link TO Admiral Markets

2. **Adjust Crawler Configuration**
   ```python
   # Wait for specific content to load
   wait_until="networkidle2"  # Wait for network to be idle
   wait_for="article"  # Wait for article element
   ```

3. **Use Alternative Data Sources**
   - Wikipedia and educational sites (more crawler-friendly)
   - News sites with proper HTML structure
   - Forums with server-side rendering

### Medium-term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Implement Playwright with Stealth**
   - Better JavaScript execution
   - Anti-detection measures
   - Custom wait conditions

2. **Add Manual URL Review Process**
   - For high-value URLs that fail crawling
   - Human verification of compliance issues

3. **API Integrations**
   - Some sites offer APIs for content access
   - More reliable than web scraping

### Long-term (1+ month)
1. **Distributed Crawling Infrastructure**
   - Multiple IP addresses
   - Residential proxies
   - Rate limiting per domain

2. **Machine Learning Content Extraction**
   - Train models to extract main content
   - Handle various page structures

3. **Partnership Agreements**
   - Direct data access from content providers
   - Bulk content licensing

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Test with Admiral Markets Backlinks**
   - Use the 67k URLs from referring pages
   - These are more likely to mention Admiral Markets
   - Should have better crawling success rate

2. **Focus on Working Domains**
   - Wikipedia.org
   - Reddit.com
   - Bloomberg.com
   - Other domains that worked in testing

3. **Implement Retry Logic**
   - Exponential backoff
   - Domain-specific retry strategies
   - Fallback to simpler extraction methods

4. **Create Test Dataset**
   - Manually verify 10-20 URLs with Admiral Markets mentions
   - Use for testing compliance detection
   - Ensure end-to-end pipeline works
