# Admiral Markets Mention Detection Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a filtering system that only analyzes web pages containing mentions of Admiral Markets, significantly reducing processing time and focusing analysis on relevant content.

## Implementation Date
May 29, 2025

## Technical Details

### Pattern Matching
The system searches for the following Admiral Markets variations:
- `admiral markets` (with space)
- `admiralmarkets` (no space)  
- `admiral.markets` (with dot)
- `admiral-markets` (with hyphen)

All patterns are case-insensitive.

### Context Extraction
When mentions are found, the system extracts:
- 100 words before the mention
- 100 words after the mention
- Position information (start, end, percentage in document)
- The exact matched text

### Integration Points

#### 1. Crawl4AI Service (`app/services/crawlers/crawl4ai_service.py`)
- Added `_find_admiral_mentions()` method
- Added `_extract_context_around_mention()` method
- Modified `extract_content()` to check for mentions and skip if none found

#### 2. Firecrawl Service (`app/services/crawlers/firecrawl_service.py`)
- Same methods added as Crawl4AI
- Consistent implementation across both crawlers

#### 3. URL Processor (`app/core/url_processor.py`)
- Updated `crawl_urls()` to respect the `skip_analysis` flag
- Logs skip reason when no mentions found
- Updates URL status to `SKIPPED` with `NO_MENTION` filter reason

### Benefits
1. **Performance**: Reduces analysis time by skipping irrelevant pages
2. **Cost**: Saves API credits by not analyzing pages without mentions
3. **Accuracy**: Focuses compliance checking on pages that actually reference Admiral Markets
4. **Context**: Provides relevant context for compliance decisions

### Testing Results
- Tested on 10 external URLs - all correctly skipped (no mentions)
- Tested on forex broker listing pages - unexpectedly no mentions found
- Identified issue: Some pages return 404 errors or minimal content

### Next Steps
1. Find reliable test URLs that mention Admiral Markets
2. Test with Admiral Markets' own backlink data
3. Verify compliance detection with real Admiral Markets mentions
4. Monitor performance improvements in production

### Code Example
```python
# Check for Admiral Markets mentions
mentions = self._find_admiral_mentions(markdown)

if not mentions:
    logger.info(f"No Admiral Markets mentions found on {url}, skipping analysis")
    return {
        "skip_analysis": True,
        "skip_reason": "No Admiral Markets mentions found"
    }

# Extract context around mentions
mention_contexts = []
for start, end, mention_text in mentions:
    context = self._extract_context_around_mention(markdown, start, end)
    mention_contexts.append(context)
